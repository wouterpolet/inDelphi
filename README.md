# inDelphi reproduction

This is a copied repo of https://github.com/maxwshen/indelphi-dataprocessinganalysis with some adaptations for the Machine Learning in Bioinformatics course at TU Delft.

# Data Availability:

Prediction Outcomes Files: extended_prediction_output_20220314_2255.pkl

# Execution Steps and procedures
TODO fill with args and options for exec (should be plug and play for staff)#
Load only pre-trained model 3f named 3f_all_samples in the output folder
and load pre-calculated predictions from the folder predictions

--process=3f --model_folder=3f_all_samples --load_pred=True

Load only pre-trained model 4b named 4b_all_samples in the output folder
and load pre-calculated predictions from the folder predictions

--process=4b --model_folder=4b_all_samples --load_pred=True

# Large Files
Due to some files being larger than 100MB, an external url, is used to access them.
These can be generated using the application but usually take some time (from 2-16 hours depending on size and complexity)
