# Execution Steps and procedures
TODO fill with args and options for exec (should be plug and play for staff)#
Load only pre-trained model 3f named 3f_all_samples in the output folder
and load pre-calculated predictions from the folder predictions

--process=3f --model_folder=3f_all_samples --load_pred=True

Load only pre-trained model 4b named 4b_all_samples in the output folder
and load pre-calculated predictions from the folder predictions

--process=4b --model_folder=4b_all_samples --load_pred=True
